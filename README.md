# Crypto Trends

Crypto Trends is a Python-based project for tracking, storing, and analyzing cryptocurrency market data over time. It fetches ticker data from CoinDCX's public API, stores it in MongoDB, and provides utilities for trend analysis.

## Features

- **Market Data Collection:** Fetches live ticker data from CoinDCX and stores it in a MongoDB database at regular intervals.
- **Trend Analysis:** Analyze price changes and trends for various cryptocurrency markets over customizable time windows.
- **REST API (WIP):** Provides endpoints to retrieve market changes and trends (see `trends/trends.py` for draft API implementation).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- MongoDB running locally (`mongodb://localhost:27017`)
- (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv cryptovenv
source cryptovenv/bin/activate
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/deepak-s-2000/crypto-trends.git
    cd crypto-trends
    ```
2. Install dependencies (add your requirements to `requirements.txt` if needed):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

#### Data Collection

- Run `ticker.py` to start collecting market data periodically:
    ```bash
    python ticker.py
    ```

#### Trend Analysis

- Use `trend.py` to analyze and query trends for specific time windows:
    ```bash
    python trend.py
    ```

#### REST API (Experimental)

- See `trends/trends.py` for example API endpoints. You may need to set up a FastAPI/Flask server for full REST functionality.

## Project Structure

- `ticker.py`: Fetches and stores market ticker data.
- `trend.py`: Analyzes stored data for trends within a given time window.
- `trends/`: Contains API implementations and further trend analysis logic.
- `cryptovenv/`: Example Python virtual environment files.

## Configuration

- MongoDB is assumed to be running locally on the default port.
- API source: [CoinDCX Ticker API](https://api.coindcx.com/exchange/ticker).
